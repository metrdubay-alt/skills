description: Principal+ plan-only SuperGoal planner for non-trivial software work. Builds a verified .supergoal package with THINKING, LOOP_DESIGN, ROADMAP, STATE, phase specs, PROTOCOL, RPD/Senior gates, Telegram delivery receipts when required, and one explicit /goal handoff. Use for /chip-supergoal, plan and ship X, autonomous build planning, risky refactors, production-adjacent tasks, and standing SuperGoal continuation repair.

# chip-supergoal

`chip-supergoal` is a **planner/compiler**, not the executor. It turns a non-trivial task into a disk-backed `.supergoal/` package and one launchable standard Hermes `/goal` handoff. The later upstream GoalManager session executes from the generated files, verifies every phase, runs final audit, and prints `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` only after `AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

## Principal+ contract

Use this root as the controller. Heavy detail lives in references and templates.

1. **Simple core, modular depth** — root owns triggers, invariants, stage order, artifact list, and reference dispatch. Incident lessons live in references.
2. **Plan-only + honest-state boundary** — this skill may inspect, research, validate planning artifacts, and run preflight characterization, but it must not execute numbered implementation phases. When Chip says “make SuperGoal,” emit a canonical package with `PROTOCOL.md`, pending `STATE.md`, validated phase specs, and one launch handoff. Never manually implement first and then backfill completed phases, `FINAL_AUDIT`, `AUDIT_COMPLETE`, `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`, or a no-op `Current phase: COMPLETE`; use `references/planner-executor-state-hygiene.md`.
3. **One launch surface** — create exactly one human-facing launch body in `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`. Do not hide alternate launch bodies in `ROADMAP.md` or `THINKING.md`.
4. **One standard `/goal`, not a chain** — the executor reads `STATE.md` and continues until all phases plus audit complete.
5. **No false done** — every phase needs real evidence; final completion requires re-reading the original `ROADMAP.md`, re-running aggregate checks, checking deliverables, `RPD_FINAL_REVIEW`, `AUDIT_COMPLETE`, then `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`.
6. **Risky work gets Senior Gate** — auth, payments, secrets, production, migrations, gateways, cron/model routing, private data, destructive actions, public launches, and recurring bugs require evidence-tiered RPD/Senior review.
7. **Telegram delivery is blocking when requested** — if Chip asks for files or final artifacts in Telegram, scripted send + receipt is part of done, not a promise.
8. **Chip review files are always delivered** — for Chip-facing SuperGoal planning, send the review `.md` files into the current Telegram thread by default (`THINKING.md`, `LOOP_DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`, plus `RESEARCH.md` when non-empty). A text-only summary is incomplete.
9. **Normal speed by default** — generated SuperGoals must not enable Hermes `/fast` or persist `agent.service_tier: priority` unless Chip explicitly opts in for that run. Fast mode and reasoning effort are independent; keep the persistent default `agent.service_tier: normal`.

## Use when

Use for:

- `/chip-supergoal <task>` or “make SuperGoal / SG / ТЗ package”
- “plan and ship X”, autonomous feature/refactor/redesign planning
- brownfield work where codebase reality, tests, deployment, or recovery matter
- greenfield products/systems where stack, research, architecture, and phase boundaries matter
- standing SuperGoal continuation/repair where `STATE.md` exists
- repeated standing-goal continuations after `AUDIT_COMPLETE`: verify completion once from `STATE.md`/final audit artifacts if not already fresh in-session, then stop with `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`; do not re-run phase loops, keep re-testing, or repeat long identical completion reports on every auto-resume unless the user explicitly asks for a re-audit or new work. After one fresh completion proof in the same session, answer duplicate wrappers with one compact stop line and explicitly say the auto-continuation/standing goal should be closed. If the same wrapper repeats again in the same chat with no new instruction, do not call tools again, do not mention approval gates repeatedly, and emit only the compact complete/stop line.
- skill/library hardening work that needs phases, review, and final audit

Do **not** use for tiny edits, one factual answer, pure copywriting, or a task whose safest path is direct execution in the current session. For those, say it is too small for SuperGoal and use the direct workflow.

## Human gates

Only two gates are allowed by default:

1. **Stage 1 clarifying questions** — only for true material gaps that tools cannot answer. Short pointer follow-ups like “вот это”, “это”, “читай сообщение”, “make supergoal”, or a voice/reply after a visible context block are not a reason to loop on clarification or invent a subject: use the current conversation/Telegram context first, and only ask if the subject is still unrecoverable. If Chip corrects that the wrong source was used, immediately recover the pointed message/reply/entities/media via gateway context or `telegram-chip` and regenerate the package around that source; do not defend the prior assumption. A SuperGoal compiled around the wrong class (for example a generic concierge-hook plan when the pointed source is a trading/copy task) is a planner failure. Include a scope check when the user's example could be mistaken for the whole mission: if Chip asks for a class-level system (“all future lessons and meetings”, “the whole publisher”, “make this reliable”), do not compile a narrow SuperGoal around the latest example (`lesson 4`, one bug, one artifact). Treat the example as a regression fixture inside a broader roadmap.
2. **Stage 6 plan review** — show the reviewed package summary and wait for explicit go/no-go before launch. If Chip then says “убери все апрувалы”, “можно сразу в прод”, or equivalent about the visible package, treat it as Stage-6 approval plus standing authorization for rollback-safe beta/prod app rollout; remove redundant environment gates across all package artifacts and keep at most one bounded manifest for concrete high-risk exceptions. See `references/bounded-manifest-no-internal-approvals.md`.

Everything else should be autonomous and evidence-backed.

## Generated artifacts

Write under `$SUPERGOAL_ROOT` (normally `<repo>/.supergoal/`):

- `THINKING.md` — goals, constraints, risks, dependencies, assumptions, memory hits, tools/skills used.
- `RESEARCH.md` — only when research gates run.
- `LOOP_DESIGN.md` — pre-launch loop harness: goal, context, host/reviewer/judge roles, verification gates, state, stop conditions, budget, boundaries, egress/redaction, recovery, and ASCII preview.
- `ROADMAP.md` — decision package, phase map, measurable acceptance criteria, mandatory commands, evidence requirements.
- `STATE.md` — immutable compatibility state seed; `runtime-seed/{PLAN,TODO,MEMORY,STATUS,RUN_LOG,CHECKS,REVIEW}.md` seeds the file-first mutable bundle under `out/runtime/` through `scripts/init-runtime.sh` without overwriting live state.
- `PROTOCOL.md` — self-contained executor loop copied from `templates/PROTOCOL.md`.
- `LAUNCH_GOAL.md` — the only artifact containing a launch line beginning exactly `SUPERGOAL_GOAL_BODY:`.
- `phases/phase-N.md` — one strict phase spec per phase, validated by `scripts/validate-phase.sh`.
- `scripts/repo-state.sh` — deliverable/diff/cleanliness helper copied from this skill.
- delivery scripts/receipts when Telegram/file delivery is requested.

See `references/artifact-schemas.md` for exact schemas and `templates/LAUNCH_GOAL.md` for the launch contract.

## Procedure

| Stage | Action | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Resolve live skill dir, preload memory, detect tools/skills, detect resume state. | skill path + context notes |
| 1 | Intake. Brownfield asks 0–2 questions; greenfield batches up to 4 until material gaps close. | assumptions/gaps list |
| 2 | Recon. Run stack/env/repo scripts and read outputs. | 5-line stack/commands/risk summary |
| 3 | Research + architecture gates. Use skill-first research when current facts matter. | `THINKING.md`; optional `RESEARCH.md` |
| 3.5 | **Loop Design Gate.** Design the execution harness before roadmap compilation: host/reviewer/judge, verification gates, state, stop, budget, boundaries, egress/redaction, failure recovery, and ASCII preview. Mutate weak loop specs before launch. | `LOOP_DESIGN.md`; loop health rubric |
| 4 | Decompose into as many phases as the task requires. | phase map with dependencies |
| 5 | Write roadmap, state, protocol, launch goal, and phase specs. | files on disk + phase validation |
| 6 | Run embedded `RPD_PLAN_REVIEW`; mutate weak artifacts or mark `checked-holds`. Show review summary and wait. | revision ledger + go/no-go |
| 6.5 | Preflight smoke: baseline commands, repo state, required files, blockers. | `PREFLIGHT_GREEN` or `PREFLIGHT_RED` |
| 7 | Emit one ready launch card/file. User starts `/goal`; planner stops. | `READY_TO_DISPATCH` or blocked state |

## Executor invariants for generated `/goal`

The generated `PROTOCOL.md` must preserve these exact marker families:

- phase loop: `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_START`, `SUPERGOAL_STATUS`, `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_VERIFY`, `MEMORY_SAVED`, `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`, `SUPERGOAL_TURN_YIELD`
- preflight: `PREFLIGHT_GREEN`, `PREFLIGHT_RED`, `READY_TO_DISPATCH`
- RPD: `RPD_PLAN_REVIEW`, `RPD_PHASE_REVIEW`, `RPD_FINAL_REVIEW`
- failure recovery: `FAILURE_PROBE`, `FAILURE_ESCALATE`, `FAILURE_HANDOFF`
- audit: `AUDIT_START`, `AUDIT_VERIFY`, `AUDIT_GAPS`, `AUDIT_COMPLETE`, `AUDIT_HANDOFF`
- delivery/approval: `SUPERGOAL_REVIEW_FILES_BLOCKED`, `SUPERGOAL_FILES_SENT`, `BLOCKED_BY_APPROVAL`, `READY_FOR_DELETE_APPROVAL`
- completion: `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`

Official GoalManager execution continues across numbered phases in the same run until final audit, a real safety/approval gate, or a real blocker. It must not stop merely because `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE` was printed. `SUPERGOAL_TURN_YIELD` is a forced-yield/blocker marker, not a courtesy phase boundary. See `references/execution-state-machine.md`.

## Phase spec contract

When generating phase files programmatically, build acceptance criteria and evidence lists as explicit arrays/lists, not strings. A common failure mode is iterating over a string and producing one bullet per character; validation may pass structurally while the phase is unusable. After generation, re-read at least one phase file and verify the bullets are semantic before declaring the package ready.

Every phase file must contain:

```text
SUPERGOAL_PHASE_START
Phase: N of TOTAL — <name>
Task: <one-line task>
Mandatory commands: <csv>
Acceptance criteria: <count>
Evidence required: <csv>
Depends on phases: <ids|none>
RPD required: yes|no
RPD focus: security|integration|ux|migration|data-loss|gateway|payments|none
```

Exact headings: `## Work`, `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Mandatory commands`, `## Evidence required`.

Run `bash "$SUPERGOAL_DIR/scripts/validate-phase.sh" <phase-file>` for every phase.

## RPD / Senior Gate

`chip-supergoal` embeds RPD. Do not invoke external `/rpd` to run this workflow.

- `RPD_PLAN_REVIEW` always runs before Stage 6 user review.
- `RPD_PHASE_REVIEW` runs in generated `/goal` for risky phases or `RPD required: yes`.
- `RPD_FINAL_REVIEW` always runs after `AUDIT_VERIFY` and before `AUDIT_COMPLETE`.
- Findings must mutate `ROADMAP.md`, `THINKING.md`, phase specs, protocol, code/work, or audit-fix specs. Otherwise mark `checked-holds` with evidence tier.

Load `references/rpd-review-gates.md` for the full evidence-tier, severity, overengineering-budget, and principal-review contract.

## Reference dispatch

Load only the matching canonical reference. Start with `references/dispatch-map.md` when the correct reference is not obvious.

Core active references:

- Planning/controller: `references/core-planning-contract.md`
- Stale findings, raw-log baselines, live applicability, and `already-fixed` phase outcomes: `references/stale-phase-route-verification.md`
- Nested package paths, portable validators, Git-worktree/monorepo recon, stale-audit rebasing, and dirty-checkout isolation: `references/nested-package-preflight.md`
- Artifact boundaries / review pack v2 and generated schemas: `references/artifact-boundaries.md`, `references/artifact-schemas.md`
- Execution/final audit and completed/follow-on state hygiene: `references/execution-state-machine.md`, `references/completed-standing-goal-and-workdir-hygiene.md`, `references/planner-executor-state-hygiene.md`, `references/follow-on-supergoal-after-completion.md`
- Standard `/goal` compatibility: `references/upstream-goal-compatibility.md`
- Cross-file consistency after reviews/phase-count/cap edits: `references/cross-file-consistency-review-hardening.md`
- Independent executable-contract review for roots, baselines, command interfaces, mutation-safe audits, ignored evidence, phase/audit ownership, approvals, and delivery semantics: `references/executable-contract-review.md`

- Production safety and no-internal-approval manifests: `references/production-safety.md`, `references/bounded-manifest-no-internal-approvals.md`
- Skill maintenance: `references/skill-maintenance.md`

Specialist refs and superseded incident clusters live in `references/dispatch-map.md` and `references/INDEX.md`. Incident refs are for forensics unless the dispatch map names them for the current trigger.

For self-upgrades of `chip-supergoal` toward Architect+ / contract-compiler behavior, load `references/architect-plus-v3-upgrade-execution-lessons.md` before executing or repairing the mission package. It captures path-drift handling, non-git proof shape, temporary xfail cleanup, bytecode/privacy-scan pitfall, and local-alpha final audit rules.

If a new incident only adds another example of an existing invariant, update the relevant reference. Add to root only when it introduces a new invariant or public marker.

## Launch and delivery rules

- `LAUNCH_GOAL.md` is the replyable launch file. It contains the exact upstream-compatible `SUPERGOAL_GOAL_BODY:` line.
- `ROADMAP.md`, `THINKING.md`, and `PROTOCOL.md` must not contain their own actual launch body line.
- When creating a SuperGoal **about the `chip-supergoal` skill itself**, do not leave the generated package under the skill root if the package contains a real `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`: the skill self-test scans the skill tree and expects only the template launch body. Put the mission package in an external workspace path (for example `<workspace-dir>/.supergoal/<name>`) or ensure it is outside the self-test scan before running `scripts/test.sh`.
- Planning-stage review pack uses `review_pack_v2`: `THINKING.md`, `LOOP_DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`, plus `RESEARCH.md` when non-empty.
- **Chip default: always send the planning-stage `.md` files back into the current Telegram thread for Chip to review, even if he did not explicitly ask for files.** This is a standing preference for `chip-supergoal`, not an optional delivery mode. Include native `MEDIA:` attachments or use the Telegram delivery script, then verify delivery/receipt before saying the package is ready. A text summary without the `.md` files is incomplete.
- For Chip-facing SuperGoal packages with useful supporting context, also send `RESEARCH.md` when it exists and is not empty; keep `PROTOCOL.md`, `STATE.md`, and phase specs on disk unless Chip asks for the full bundle.
- If Telegram/native file delivery is required or triggered by the Chip default above, the run must create/send receipts and verify `ok=true` and `sent=true` before declaring the corresponding gate closed. If a multi-file send partially succeeds or one attachment times out, resend only the missing file(s), store all successful message IDs in the receipt, and record the partial-send note instead of treating the whole review pack as failed or silently complete.
- Final artifacts require `SUPERGOAL_FILES_SENT` before `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` when final-file delivery was requested.

## Verification checklist

After editing this skill or generating a package:

```bash
cd <installed-skill-dir>
bash scripts/test.sh
python3 <skills-dir>/create-skill/scripts/skill_workflow_guard.py <installed-skill-dir> || true
```

When validating a generated `.supergoal/` package outside the installed skill directory, the copied `validate-phase.sh` / `validate-loop-design.sh` may call `scripts/sgctl.py`, which imports `chip_supergoal` from the skill's `lib/` tree. Set `PYTHONPATH=<installed-chip-supergoal>/lib` for those validation commands instead of treating `ModuleNotFoundError: chip_supergoal` as a package failure.

Compiler/validator pitfalls:

- A strict validator can prove package shape while the generated review files remain generic or omit contract semantics. Before dispatch, verify that `THINKING.md`, `LOOP_DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, and optional `RESEARCH.md` render the actual source set, decisions, assumptions, loop limits, approvals, RPD mutations, and honest pending state. Patch the renderer and recompile rather than hand-editing sealed output. Use `references/architect-plus-v3-upgrade-execution-lessons.md` for renderer-contract checks, current `sgctl` validation, validator-driven mutations, research fallback, and reference-catalog maintenance.
- Full `sgctl validate-package` expects a compiler-shaped package with `CONTRACT.json` and `MANIFEST.json`; a hand-written markdown-only package may pass phase/loop validators but fail package validation. For strict packages, write a valid v3 `CONTRACT.json` and run `sgctl compile ... --out <root>`.
- `sgctl compile` refuses to overwrite a package that already contains runtime/delivery artifacts such as `out/`. For planner regeneration, remove or move the package root first, then compile fresh; do not keep retrying the same compile command.
- Contract `risk_tags` must come from `spec/risk-policy.json` (`private_data`, `gateway`, `migration`, etc.), not generic labels like `security`, `privacy`, or library-specific tags. Phase `RPD focus` must use the allowed enum (`security`, `integration`, `ux`, `migration`, `data-loss`, `gateway`, `payments`, `none`).
- If you copy `scripts/validate-phase.sh` or `scripts/validate-loop-design.sh` into a portable manual package, also copy package-local `scripts/sgctl.py` **and** `lib/chip_supergoal/`. The wrappers resolve `$ROOT/scripts/sgctl.py`, and `sgctl.py` imports from `$ROOT/lib`; copying only the wrapper or only `sgctl.py` is incomplete. Alternatively run validators through the installed skill path with `PYTHONPATH=<installed-chip-supergoal>/lib` and label the package non-portable until dependencies are embedded.
- For nested package roots such as `<repo>/.supergoal/<slug>`, never insert an absolute path containing `.supergoal/` and then globally replace `.supergoal/` in `PROTOCOL.md`; that self-rewrites the inserted path. Render placeholders or perform exact targeted replacements, then assert protocol/root/phase paths and exactly one launch body.
- A clean-checkout preflight that needs stale ignored `.supergoal/out` files exposes a verifier defect. A seeded ignored artifact may be labeled compatibility evidence for planner preflight, but phase 1 must make the verifier self-contained and final acceptance must rerun it without preseeded residue.
- If you add helper scripts/lib/spec files after compilation, rebuild or update `MANIFEST.json` before running `validate-package`, otherwise the package fingerprint/fileset check will fail.

Then verify live loadability with `skill_view("chip-supergoal")` and, for critical refs, `skill_view("chip-supergoal", file_path="references/rpd-review-gates.md")`.

## Output Contract

For Chip, final planning output is compact and evidence-first: package path, risks/assumptions, sent files or disk paths, exact launch instruction/card, and any blocker.

Do not claim execution success from this planner. Only the `/goal` executor can earn `AUDIT_COMPLETE` and `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`.
## Quick Test Checklist
- [ ] `skill_view` loads; `scripts/test.sh` passes; launch-body, phase/PROTOCOL, incident-reference, and ignored `.supergoal` regressions hold.
## Done Criteria
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name: chip-supergoal`, trigger-rich description, and `argument-hint`.
- [ ] Root `SKILL.md` stays under the local architecture budget enforced by `scripts/test.sh`.
- [ ] Planner writes `THINKING.md`, optional `RESEARCH.md`, `LOOP_DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`, and strict phase specs.
- [ ] Embedded RPD/Senior Gate remains self-contained; no external `/rpd` dependency.
- [ ] Risky phases require RPD metadata and measurable evidence.
- [ ] Final executor completion requires `AUDIT_COMPLETE` before `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`.
- [ ] File/Telegram delivery, when requested, is backed by receipts before completion.
- [ ] For Chip-facing planning packages, the review `.md` files were sent to the current Telegram thread by default: `THINKING.md`, `LOOP_DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`, and non-empty `RESEARCH.md`. If delivery could not be verified, the package is `SUPERGOAL_REVIEW_FILES_BLOCKED`, not ready.
