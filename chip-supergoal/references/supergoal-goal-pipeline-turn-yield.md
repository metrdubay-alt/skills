# Supergoal → /goal pipeline: continuous execution / forced-yield discipline

## Durable lesson

Chip expects a SuperGoal to run through all safe phases and final audit without stopping at normal phase boundaries. A phase boundary is a checkpoint for `STATE.md` and evidence, not a reason to return control.

`SUPERGOAL_TURN_YIELD` is still a marker, but it means **forced yield**: platform/tool budget cutoff, real safety/approval blocker, or other unavoidable pause. It must not be emitted as a courtesy stop after every `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`.

## Execution rule

Treat `/goal` as the scheduler and keep working until one terminal condition is reached:

1. Read `STATE.md` and the current `phase-N.md`.
2. Run the phase, print `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_VERIFY`, print `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`, update `STATE.md`.
3. Immediately continue to phase N+1 or `AUDIT`.
4. Stop only for:
   - `AUDIT_COMPLETE` + `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`;
   - forced platform/tool cutoff;
   - real safety/approval blocker;
   - unrecoverable verification failure after the recovery protocol.

## False blockers

Do not stop for these when they are part of Chip's requested private verification:

- private DM smoke/readback to Chip's own bot or Chip DM;
- local tests, compile/lint/typecheck, repo cleanup;
- read-only service/config/log/usage/ledger inspections;
- direct low-risk smoke with an already configured scoped key;
- report/state writes and evidence packaging.

If they fail, repair/retry or classify as a verification failure. Do not ask for approval unless the repair would touch a real gate.

## Real gates

Real gates are money/topup/trading, DNS, secrets/credential disclosure or creation, grants/access changes, destructive production mutation, public/mass posts, permanent default-model switch, plugin disable, session reset, or missing credentials/external outage after retrieval attempts.

## Operator pitfall

If Chip says the goal stalled, do not explain the old one-phase protocol. Read `STATE.md`, reassess any blocker, and continue. If a prior generated package still encodes one-phase-per-turn, patch its `PROTOCOL.md` / `LAUNCH_GOAL.md` before resuming.

## Resuming / finishing an existing plan

When Chip asks to finish a partially completed SuperGoal:

1. Read existing `.supergoal/STATE.md`.
2. Preserve completed phases as evidence.
3. Patch stale executor text that says to stop after each phase.
4. Continue from the current phase through final audit.
5. Use `SUPERGOAL_TURN_YIELD` only if forced to yield or truly blocked.

## Marker contract

Successful phase checkpoint:

```text
SUPERGOAL_PHASE_START
SUPERGOAL_PHASE_VERIFY
SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE
```

Forced-yield/blocker checkpoint, only when needed:

```text
SUPERGOAL_TURN_YIELD
Goal complete: no
Next: <phase|AUDIT|blocked marker>
```

Final completion:

```text
AUDIT_COMPLETE
SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE
Goal complete: yes
```
