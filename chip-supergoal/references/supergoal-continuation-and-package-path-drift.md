# SuperGoal continuation and package path drift

Use when executing or resuming a SuperGoal from a gateway `/goal` continuation.

## Completed wrapper / compression split-brain

If a continuation targets a SuperGoal root whose `.supergoal/STATE.md` is already complete, do not execute phases again and do not keep repeating completion markers.

Check disk state first:

- `.supergoal/STATE.md` has `Status: COMPLETE` and `Current phase: complete` (or equivalent final phase);
- final markers include `AUDIT_COMPLETE` and `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`;
- handoff/final report exists if the protocol required it.

If compression or gateway state created a new active `goal:<session>` row for that completed root, close that stale active row as `done` with a disk-backed reason. This prevents auto-resume from re-injecting the stale wrapper.

Do not restart a completed root unless Chip explicitly names a new root or a new goal.

## Package path drift

Some generated packages keep human review files at project root (`ROADMAP.md`, `THINKING.md`, `LAUNCH_GOAL.md`) while protocol/phases/state live under `.supergoal/`. A continuation may still say `.supergoal/ROADMAP.md`.

Do not block on that mismatch by itself. Verify package reality:

1. Read `.supergoal/MANIFEST.json` if present.
2. Run or inspect `.supergoal/scripts/validate-supergoal.sh`.
3. Use the actual path expected by the package validator.
4. Record the correction in the phase report.

Example: if validator checks root `ROADMAP.md`, use root `ROADMAP.md` even if the continuation text says `.supergoal/ROADMAP.md`.

## Live-activation SuperGoals

When the SuperGoal is a live-capability rail, `делай` / `continue` can authorize implementing fail-closed code phases, but it is not exact approval for money/custody mutation. Keep live actions blocked until the protocol’s exact current-chat approval packet is present and readback is possible.
